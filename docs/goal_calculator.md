# Project/problem

Lets create a commandline application that is meant to tell us how far we are from our goals!

In this application, the program will need a few pieces of information:
- Name, age, current salary
- The goal you are trying to achieve and the total cost of it
- How long you'd like to spend trying to achieve that goal

# Example:

console >> Hi welcome to the goal calculator!
        >> What is your name?
>> Brian Fontillas
console >> What is your age?
>> 28
console >> What is your current salary?
>> 100000

-----

console >> What are you trying to achieve?
>> a new car
console >> How much would your **car** cost?
>> 30000
console >> How long would you like to have it by? (years)
>> 2

>> Number calculated
